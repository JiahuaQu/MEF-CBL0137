This repository contains the code needed to reproduce the analysis of NGS experiments in the paper: **MY-SUPER-PAPER-TITLE**.

Each subfolder is devoted to a particular experiment and contains code together with a Docker file to reproduce the environment. 

All versions of used software are explicitly pinned in Docker files to guarantee reproducibility in the future. Code was tested on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, docker v20.10.2), work on other systems(Windows, Mac OS) is not guaranteed.


Note that figures in the publication are hand-edited versions of graphs created with these scripts.
