This repository contains the code to reproduce the analysis of NGS experiments in the paper: **ADAR1 loss unmasks the
antitumor immunotherapeutic potential of ZBP1-driven necroptosis**.

Each subfolder is devoted to a particular experiment and contains scripts together with a Docker file to reproduce the
environment.

All software versions are explicitly pinned in Docker files to guarantee reproducibility in the future. Code was tested
on Linux (Ubuntu 18.04, docker v20.10.2), work on other systems(Windows, Mac OS) is not guaranteed.

Note that figures in the publication are hand-edited versions of graphs created with published scripts.
